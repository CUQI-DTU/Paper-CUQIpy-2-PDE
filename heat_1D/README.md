To generate figures 2 and 3 in the paper, run the script demo_figures.py.
 
To solve the four cases presented in the paper of the 1D heat Bayesian Inverse Problem, run the file heat_1D.py. It will generate data folders inside the folder `data2_cont6` for each case:

- `paper_case35` for the KL expansion case presented in the second row of Figure 5
- `paper_case37` for the KL expansion case presented in the third row of Figure 5
- `paper_case38` for the KL expansion case presented in the fourth row of Figure 5
- `paper_case46` for the step expansion case presented in the second row of Figure 4

After generating the data, to generate figure 4 in the paper, run `figure4.py` and to generate figure 5 run `figure5.py`.
