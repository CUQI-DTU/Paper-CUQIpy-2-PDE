# Instructions for running the PAT 1D Bayesian Inverse Problem

To generate figures 10, 11, and 12 in the paper, run the script `PAT.py`.

This script performs the sampling using the pCN method for the photo-acoustic forward problem and them plots the data, estimates for the pressure profile and estimates of the Bayesian parameters.
 
To switch between the full-boundary data and partial data you can comment and uncomment lines 38, 39 and 42, 43, i.e. for full-data use the lines 38 and 42, for partial data use the lines 39 and 43.
